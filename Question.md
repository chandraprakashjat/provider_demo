1.Provider:- It is state managment technique.
           It seprate State from the UI.
           It is extended or wrapper over Inherited widget.
           It make Inherited widget more usable and easier to use.

How can we update/render the actual consumer of state only. bcz setState() rebuild whole non const child widget that is very time and cpu consuming process.

2. Component of Provider :- 
                          ChangeNotifier
                          ChangeNotifierProvider
                          Consumer


3. Why we used Provider over InheritedWidget ?
